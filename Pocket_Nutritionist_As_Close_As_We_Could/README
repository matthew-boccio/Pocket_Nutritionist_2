Hello! Thank you for coming to view my app. 

I created this app for a project at the New York City Data Science Academy. Due to my limited experience with R, the first 
few versions of this app have many bugs, and often don't work as intended at all. But I will continue to update this app and 
make it functional so that I and others can use it as they like!

Please refer to global.R, server.R, and ui.R for the code used. 

The .csv files are the data that I used 

And the ppt. presentations is what I presented to the class. 

The other files in here are just pictures that I used in the powerpoint presentaiton.
